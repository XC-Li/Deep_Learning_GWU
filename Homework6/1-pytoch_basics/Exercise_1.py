# Q1:  Rewrite the "2_tensor_pytorch.py" file in Neural Network Design Book,
# Chapter 11 notation (Check the Summary Page) and find out
# what are the differences. Explain your findings.




# --------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Q2: Use the time package of python and test it on "1_Numpy.py" code and save the 
# running time. Change the dtype to torch tensor save the running time as well. 
# Comapre the timing results. Explain your findings. 




# --------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Q3: Keep the data size same and change the number of epochs for Q2.
# Comapre the timing results. Explain your findings. 



# --------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Q4: Increase the data size and keep the number of epochs for Q2 (Hints: Big number for epochs).
# Comapre the timing results. Explain your findings. 



# ----------------------------------------------------------------------------'
# Q5: Keep the data size big and keep the number of epochs big. Change the dtype to 
# torch tensor cuda and compare it with numpy.
# Comapre the timing results. Explain your findings.
