## Report for Exam 1
### By Xiaochi (George) Li

## Question 1
After fixing all the bugs and errors. The overall accuracy of the Neural Network is around 44%.   
Setting: Epoch=10, learning rate=0.1,momentum = 0.9, hidder size=30.  
I will fine tune the hyper-parameters in the future.  

## Question 2
Time for running on CPU is 8.5 sec per epoch, however using cuda didn't speed up the training significantly.  
Overall accuracy is 44% with the same hyper-parameter.
